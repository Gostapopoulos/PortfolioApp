# PortfolioApp
I'm following an online course in web development. As one of the first exercises we were to get a Github account and a repo up and running. The focus of this course is to learn while building real projects that will later serve as the participants' own portfolios after completing the course. Getting acquainted with Github right off the bat seems like a very good idea. 

So this is my Portfolio page! The page itself will be a .NET MVC project.
